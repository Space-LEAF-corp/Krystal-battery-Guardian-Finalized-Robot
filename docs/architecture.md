# Architecture

## Krystal Core Battery
- **Gemstone Matrix:** Emerald, Lapis Lazuli, Quartz (scaffold), Sapphire & Ruby (conduits).
- **Thin Film:** Platinum (silver hue) for corrosion resistance and surface conductivity.
- **Ends:** Copper coils soldered both sides; bidirectional placement.

## Nano‑Ant Mesh
- **Functions:** Frequency blocking (Faraday‑like), kinetic energy harvesting, self‑healing routes.
- **Behavior:** Constantly shifting lattice; never forms the same pattern twice.

## Fluid Robot
- **Magnetic Suspension Track:** Battery slides/rotates, acting as moving ballast.
- **Gyro & Thrusters:** Mass shifting complements reaction control; thermal load distributes via motion.

## Firewall
- **Keys:** Derived from motion telemetry + mesh pattern hashes.
- **Rotation:** Time‑based and event‑based; fail‑soft reroute on anomalies.

## Simulation
- **Horizons:** 365 days, 10 years, 100 years.
- **Outputs:** Capacity (Ah), resistance (Ω), mesh efficiency (%), coil durability (%), firewall resilience (%).
